# Progetti Java

Here you can explore a diverse collection of projects implemented in Java following the MVC architecture. For the creation of graphical interfaces, we utilized the Swing framework. The construction of these projects was handled with agility, using both the Ant and Gradle systems depending on specific needs. Additionally, you will find the implementation of specialized libraries imported into the projects, covering areas such as test creation, logging string management, and the development of the application itself.

These projects stem from educational exercises conducted during the university course on Object-Oriented Programming 1 at the University of Basilicata.
